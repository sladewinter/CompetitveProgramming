# UVa-Online-Judge

My C++ solutions to some UVa Online Judge coding problems

Online Judge only supports C++11 as of now and not C++14, 
so my codes are in C++11 and not in a later version. Few codes
which require handling very large integers are in Python3 since
I dont prefer Java which has BigInteger.

Disclaimer: Atleast few of my solutions will resemble the 
style of coding in cpbook 3 by Steven Halim and Felix Halim and 
https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code since i was an 
absolute beginner to competitive coding and learned most of 
what i know from their book cpbook 3. Special thanks to them,
and i have tried to understand their algos and come up with my
own solutions wherever possible.
